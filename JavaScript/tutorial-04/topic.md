### Adding External Javascript

We have learnd how to add JavaScript to our HTML file using tag and put necessary code inside that `script` tag.  
like internal CSS it has some limitations. So dinamicity we use Exter JavaScript. Here we will learn how to do that.

```javascript
    <script>
      // This is internal JavaScript
    </script>
```

Here is how we use External Js. We don't write write any JavaScript code inside the `script` tag when we call an external JavaScript file usien `src` attribute.

```javascript
    <script src="external.js"></script>
```

at this point our `external.js` will have the JavaScript code we want to execute. but do not use `<script>` tag inside that file as `<script>` is `HTML` tag not a JavaScript _**script**_ or _**code**_.

Here is code inside our external file `external.js`

```javascript
      console.log("We are using JavaScript External File Here");

      // window.alert("JavaScript Alert!");
      // Above is an example of a Single line Comment

      /* window. alert("JavaScript External File!"); */
      // Above is example of Block Comment

      /* 'Block Comment' is oftern reffered as 'Multiline Comment'
      because one can comment several lines of code or text using 
      'Block Comment' or 'Multiline Comment' like this one.*/

      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "One External JavaScript file can be used by multiple HTML file.";
```

We can use both external and internal JavaScript in a single `HTML` file.

```html
<body>
    <p id="output"></p>
    <script>
      // This is internal JavaScript
      document.write("This code is generated by JavaScript Internal File!");
    </script>

    <script src="external.js"></script>
  </body>
```
